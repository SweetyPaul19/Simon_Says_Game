## 🧠 Game Logic Overview

- A random color is added to the sequence each round.
- The system stores the sequence in an array.
- User clicks are stored and compared with the original sequence.
- If sequences match → next level.
- If mismatch → game over.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of the game is to improve memory and concentration by correctly repeating increasingly complex color patterns.
